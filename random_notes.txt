"Why does the compiler compile an 8-bit operation that uses bitwise operators into a 16-bit operation in assembly?"
	However, in my experiment, nothing has changed. I guess GCC was smart
	enough to use 8-bit operations here.


How to setup TWI bit rate generator:
	TWBR = 7
	TWPS = 0
	==> 400kHz @ CPU clock of 12MHz

Unnamed unions and structs:
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1972003/how-to-use-anonymous-structs-unions-in-c
	http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Unnamed-Fields.html
	from "man gcc" (version 4.4.5):
	       -fms-extensions
           Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.

           Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions are only accepted
           with this option.
	Anonymous structures and unions are part of C1X standard: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C1X

HID Report Constraints:
	Each top level collection must be an application collection and reports may not
	span more than one top level collection.

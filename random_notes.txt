"Why does the compiler compile an 8-bit operation that uses bitwise operators into a 16-bit operation in assembly?"
	However, in my experiment, nothing has changed. I guess GCC was smart
	enough to use 8-bit operations here.


How to setup TWI bit rate generator:
	TWBR = 7
	TWPS = 0
	==> 400kHz @ CPU clock of 12MHz
